## Banshee
Banshee is an Osu and AudioSurf inspired game that was done for a Gr. 12 CS final project.  Libraries used include FMOD and SDL, and classes used include [BeatDetector](https://github.com/Terracorrupt/BeatDetectorForGames) and [MiniBpm](https://github.com/breakfastquay/minibpm).  Thanks to Padraig O Connor and Breakfast Quay respectively.

## Installation
Either clone the repository, or simply download the release file.

If you want to manually build, you'll need Visual Studio and a few libraries (SDL, fmod, etc.).
