/////Changelog - Starting from 12/9/16/////

12/9/16:
-Attempted fix for memory issues with reading from timestamp vector.  Converted from using pointer to reference.
-Optimization in terms of code structure

12/10/16
-Further attempted fix on memory issues.  This time, forced the timestamps vector from main to only
pass when a new beat is added.  Else, nothing is passed.
-Mouse events in terms of watching for certain mouse inputs and movement.
-Added cursor textures

12/11/16
-Keyboard events in terms of watching for certain key inputs.

12/13/16
-Keyboard inputs were further worked on.  Some optimization.
-Hitmarkers were further developed.

12/14/16
-Ring indicator added.
-Delays worked on.  Noted that by default, there appears to be a ONE SECOND delay (on average)
between detect and spawning.  However, it seems to be negligible.  Further testing required.
-MAYBE I will just delay when the new beat is passed by the delay.  Seems easier.  But it means seperating the
update method into MORE threads!

12/15/16
-Delays work now!

12/17/16 - 12/18/16
-Hitmarkers now support late and early hits
-Spawning algorithim was tweaked to allow for more diverse spreads
-Further hitmarker additions.  Now there are numbers to indicate spawning order.  Next in line -
lines to indicate direction!
-Cursor now correctly lights up when you click or tap
-Fixed crashing related to mouse events.  This was due to calling non-existing hitmarkers.  Oops.
-Cleaned up some code to make it more readable.
-Lots of new images were added.  Woot.

12/19/16
-Hitmarker indicator lights up when player can hit it for max.
-Difficulty was implemented - sort of.  The basic idea is that the time in between beats is decreased as difficulty goes up.
Furthermore, the idea is to make it so the grace period (more on that later) is lower, as well as maaybe removing the hitmarker
indicator.  No, playing at 8 beats/second is not easy - that's about 480 beats a minute.
-Grace period!  Before, you had to hit it at a pixel perfect 1000 ms from the spawning to get a hit.  Now, you have about
300 ms (800-1100 ms from spawn) to hit it.  This is indicated by the indicator (Wow!) - this may drop to 200 ms though
(800-1000 ms from spawn).
-More XY beat spawn algorithim tweaks.
-Point prompts come up if you hit or come close!  Also, if you miss entirely.
-Point passing was touched on.
-Scaling based on screen size must be added!
-Ehhh... delays are acting up a bit again!

12/20/16
-Delays FIXED!  For now, at least...
-Image quality went up.
-Points system implemented, but graphics part is not.
-Hit timings were touched again for 50 points.
-0 points added for missing.  Don't miss!
-Scaling still needs to be done!
-CPU -> initWindow() is causing 25%!

12/21/16
-Points system is done.
-FPS caps at 60 using VSync

12/23/16
-FPS caps at 120-130, instead of using VSync.  VSync was giving issues on bad PCs.
-Hitsounds added.  To be tweaked.
-Fixed keyboard inputs.

12/24/16
-Menu created, and basic button system added.
-Reworked main.cpp.  Optimized CPU usage due to how the menu was pushing it to about 40%.

12/25/16 - Merry Christmas!
-Menu further tweaked.
-File reading dabbled on.
-More calibration for beat detection and hitmarkers
-Issues with first game runs. <----- Kinda fixed by sticking a 3 second delay before starting.

12/26/16
-Spent time shopping
-Beat consistancy fixed.
-Added guiding lines to guide players to next beat.
-Added colour coding to guide players when a bunch of beats spawn.
-Menu system basically half reworked.  Mainly regarding the deletion and recreation of the
FMOD sound system when exiting.
-Pausing implemented.
-ISSUES:  Pausing not fully working, the wait period should pause as well if you pause.

12/28/16
-Pausing works 90% now.  Just need a timer to wind down when you unpause to give a chance for the player
to prepare.
-Menu for pausing added.  You can resume and quit, can't retry yet.

12/29/16
-You can now fail!
-Some issue regarding menu's lag... or something.

1/01/17
-Happy New Year!
-Failing menu done - mostly.  Still need some kind of animation if you fail or something.  Too abrupt quitting.
-Issue regarding buttons fixed.  Was due to bad hitboxes.
-Various tweaks in the code.
-ISSUES:  PAUSE AFTER UNPAUSING, THAT "POP" WHEN YOU STOP OR FAIL.  YOU ALSO NEED MARKERS TO INDICATE HOW CLOSE YOU TO FAILING.

1/02/17
-Retrying now works for normal pausing.

1/03/17
-SONG FILE PASSING IS DONE.  NOW TO DISPLAY.  USE TTF.
-BACK TO VSYNC
-PAUSE AFTER UNPAUSING - USE OSU.  POP.  SOME MENU ELEMENTS ARE PIXELY

1/04/17
-Issues regarding pausing and failing worked on.  Some kind of stalling on markers that are near deletion aren't
working.

1/05/17
-Pausing now works better.  A marker must be hit after unpausing before resuming.  This marker spawns
near the closest hitmarker.
-Pause overlay added.

1/06/17
-Issues with offsets fixed.

1/07-08/17
-Now able to select songs.
-Implementation of ttf fonts.

1/10/17
-Attempt (that works!) in fixing beat detection by using BPM.
-Pass screen added.  Kinda done.
-NEED:  POP, TEXT SCALING, AI, TUTORIAL.
-MAYBE CALIBRATION?
-LABEL STUFF
-BAH

1/11/17
-Seperating window and BeatDetector from base.  Make window, well, window class.  Game functions are another class.
-Pass screen finalized... kinda.  Still need hitboxes.

1/14/17
-Graph visualization (need to time it properly)
-Score not resetting

-Graph visualization done.  For now.
-Fixed offset issues.  Temporarily reverted BeatDetector.cpp to Jan. 10, 2017.
